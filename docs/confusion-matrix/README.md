# Confusion Matrix

In the field of machine learning and specifically 
the problem of statistical classification, a confusion 
matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific 
table layout that allows visualization of the performance 
of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in 
unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching 
matrix). Each row of the matrix represents the instances 
in a predicted class while each column represents the 
instances in an actual class (or vice versa).
