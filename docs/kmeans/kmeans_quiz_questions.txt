I received couple of emails with questions about 
KMeans quiz. I am sharing questions and my answers 
(starting with MP>>) with the whole class.

My advice: keep it simple.


(B)
You should also compute the confusion matrix for your 
clustering results.  Submit results for one sample run 
giving the initial clustering, final clusterings, and 
confusion matrix. Interpret your results to a high-school 
student.

(C)
Run K-means algorithm 50 times over the Iris dataset, 
each time using a different initialization. For each run, 
compute both the accuracy of clustering, as well as the 
k-means objective function value of the final clustering. 
Plot the distribution of these accuracies and also plot 
the distribution of the objective function values. Finally, 
give a scatter plot showing the correlation (if any) between 
the clustering accuracy and the clustering objective 
function value. Write a paragraph to interpret these graphs - 
what can you conclude?

For part B, I have two questions:

1. When it asks to "submit results for one sample run giving 
   the initial clustering, final clusterings, and confusion 
   matrix," does the one sample refer to n_init (which sets 
   the number of times we try to initialize the centroids)? So 
   would it be asking us to set n_init to 1, since it asks for 
   "one sample run?"
   
MP>>
   One sample run means: running KMeans with some parameters
   final clustering means: what soultion do you propose after 
   running Kmeans 50 times.
   
   In SciKit, Kmeans is defined as: (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)
   class sklearn.cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=8, init='k-means++', n_init=10, max_iter=300, tol=0.0001, precompute_distances='auto', verbose=0, random_state=None, copy_x=True, n_jobs=None, algorithm='auto')

   For example, you may run KMeans with different parameter 
   initializations 50 times: at each iteration you may have 
   different values for the  following parameters (you may 
   change one or many parameters):
   
   n_clusters=3 (since we know, we will have 3 clusters)
   n_init, 
   max_iter, 
   tol, 
   random_state
   
   initial clustering means the first run (with some parameters)
   final clustering means: what is your optimal/final solution

2. For the "initial clustering," is that referring to when 
   k-means iterates the first time time, meaning we set max_iter 
   to 1, like what I have shown below? And "final clustering" would 
   refer to simply letting k-means solve the lowest inertia, by 
   setting max_iter to a high number (like 1000 in my example)?
   
MP>>  Yes.


For part C, I have three questions:

1.  When it asks to "run K-means algorithm 50 times over the 
    Iris dataset, each time using a different initialization," 
    is it referring to changing n_init for each run, increasing 
    that parameter by one each time? 
    
MP>>  Yes. and you may change other parameters as well

2. Does the k-means objective function value of the final 
   clustering  refer to the minimized "error" or the inertia 
   that results from the model?
   
MP>>   Yes.

3. Finally, when I get my results for accuracy and objective function 
   value for the 50 runs, besides the first initialization of the 
   centroids, all of the other runs result in the same accuracy and 
   objective function value (unless we lower the max_iter from the 
   default 300). Do you still want us to plot these results(distribution 
   and scatter)? It seems a bit meaningless to do so, since the conclusion 
   is pretty straightforward (k-means is finding the optimal solution 
   already, with just 2 initializations)?

MP>> Each iteration can set different values for one/more:
      n_init, 
      max_iter, 
      tol, 
      random_state
    
    Then you might see different results.

============

1. First section: Do we need to use the elbow method to find the 
   best k(clusters) and plot the clusters with the label like the 
   graph below, correct?
   
MP>>   Since we know the optimal K is 3. You may still try different K's
   such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10 and then use the elbow method.
   I have not ask you to do the elbow method : but you may do it to 
   learn better [ this is an extra work and not required as part of Quiz]

2. Second section: could you please elaborate on "submit results for 
   one sample run giving the initial clustering, final clusterings, 
   and confusion matrix. do you mean by setting different “n_init=1” 
   and “n_init = 10”? 
   
MP>> Yes, you may change n_init at each iteration along with other 
     parameters I mentioned earlier.

3. Second section: by using confusion matrix, we need to have pred 
   and actual, how would you like us to divide the dataset?
   
MP>> You will not divide the data set at all. The last column 
     and the clusters which you will create can be used for 
     building the confusion matrix 

4. Third section: In class you mentioned use a loop to run the 
   kmeans 50 time with different centroid every time, does that 
   mean if k=3, I need to give three different centroids for 50 times?
   
MP>> Yes, you may change the parameters (listed above) for KMeans at 
     every iteration.

5. Third section: Are we using “metrics.accuracy_score” to find the 
   accuracy of clustering? What is the k-means objective function 
   value?
   
MP>> Yes, you may use metrics.accuracy_score 
     (or other methods suitable for KMeans)
   
     For details see: k-means objective function: https://www.saedsayad.com/clustering_kmeans.htm
     Yes, you may use inertia_ (= sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center).

6. Third section: Are we supposed to find the k-mean objective 
   function value for 50 runs and put them into a dataset then 
   plot them into a scatter plot to find the relationship between 
   each accuracy and each objective function values?
   
MP>>   Yes
