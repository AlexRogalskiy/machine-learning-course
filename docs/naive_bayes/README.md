# Naive Bayes


    In machine learning, Naïve Bayes classifiers 
    are  a  family  of  simple  "probabilistic 
    classifiers" based  on applying Bayes' theorem 
    with strong (naïve) independence assumptions 
    between the features. 

    Possible k outcomes = {C1, C2, ..., Ck}
    i =  1, 2, ..., k

                   P(Ci) P(x | Ci)
    P(Ci | x) =  -------------------
                       P(x)
                     
                     
    P(A | B) stands for "the conditional probability 
    of A given B", or "the probability of A under 
    the condition B", i.e. the probability of some 
    event A under the assumption that the event B 
    took place. 
    
    Conditional probability answers the question:
    
           how does the probability 
           of an event change if we 
           have extra information
