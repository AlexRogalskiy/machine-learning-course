# SVM -- Support Vector Machine

### Introduced in 1992
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) was first 
  heard in 1992, introduced by Boser, Guyon, 
  and  Vapnik in COLT-92. 

### SVM for Classification
* Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set 
  of related supervised learning methods used 
  for classification and regression. 

### SVM as a generalized linear classifiers
* SVMs belong to a family of generalized linear 
classifiers.

### SVM as supervised ML
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised 
  machine learning algorithm which can be used 
  for both classification or regression challenges. 
  However,  it is mostly used in classification 
  problems. 

### SVM as Binary Classification
* Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of 
  supervised learning methods used for classification, 
  regression and outliers detection.

### SVM as a non-probabilistic  classifier
* A support vector machine (SVM) is a non-probabilistic 
binary linear classifier. The nonprobabilistic aspect 
is its key strength. This aspect is in contrast with 
probabilistic classifiers such as the Naïve Bayes. 

### SVMs are fast by some features
* SVM separates data across a decision boundary 
(plane) determined by only a small subset of the 
data (feature vectors). The data subset that supports 
the decision boundary are aptly called the support 
vectors. The remaining feature vectors of the dataset 
do not have any influence in determining the position 
of the decision boundary in the feature space. 

### Probabilistic classifiers need all data
* In contrast with SVMs, probabilistic classifiers 
  develop a model that best explains the data by 
  considering all of the data versus just a small 
  subset. Subsequently, probabilistic classifiers 
  likely require more computing resources.
