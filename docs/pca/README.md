Definition: 
   PCA is a linear combination of 
   weighted observed variables.

The central idea of principal component analysis (PCA) 
is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting 
of a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining 
as much as possible of the variation present in the data set. 

This is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables,
the principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated, and 
which are ordered so that the first few retain most of the 
variation present in all of the original variables.
