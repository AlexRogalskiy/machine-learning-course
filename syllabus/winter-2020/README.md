* Students Project Presentation (LDA)

* What is TF-IDF?
	* term’s frequency (TF) and its inverse document frequency (IDF)

````
    TF-IDF  is an information retrieval technique 
    that weighs a term’s frequency (TF) and its 
    inverse document frequency (IDF). 
    
    Each word or term has its respective TF and IDF 
    score. The product of the TF and IDF scores of
    a term is called the TF-IDF weight of that term.
 
    Put simply, the higher the TF-IDF score (weight), 
    the rarer the term and vice versa.

# Session 7, January 23, 2020: K-means

### What is K-means clustering?

````
  K-means  clustering  is  a  method of  
  vector quantization,  originally from 
  signal processing, that is popular for 
  cluster analysis in data mining

  The algorithm always converges (by-definition) 
  but  not  necessarily  to  global  optimum.
````

### How does K-means work?

````
  The K-means algorithm starts by randomly 
  choosing a centroid value for each cluster. 
  After that the algorithm iteratively performs 
  three steps: 

  Given a set of data points (x1, x2,..., xn),
  K-means clustering aims to partition the n 
  data points into k (<=n) 
  sets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sk} 
  so as to minimize the within-cluster 
  sum of squares:
  
                k                    2
      arg min SUM  (SUM   || x -Mi ||   )
            i=1   X in Si

  Where Mi is the the mean of points in Si
````


### K-means Algorithm:

````
   The most commonly used algorithm is Standard 
   algorithm. Standard algorithm begins by assigning 
   k random points in the domain as the mean of each 
   cluster and then it iterates  the following  two 
   steps until it reaches the convergence:

   Step-1:   Find the Euclidean distance between 
             each data instance and centroids of 
             all the clusters; 

   Step-2:   Assign the data instances to the 
             cluster of the centroid with nearest 
             distance; 

   Step-3:   Calculate new centroid values based 
             on the mean values of the coordinates 
             of all the data instances from the 
             corresponding cluster.

# Underfitting and Overfitting

* A model that generalizes well is a model 
  that is neither underfit nor overfit.

* Underfitting

````
    Underfitting occurs when a model can’t 
    accurately capture the dependencies among 
    data, usually as a consequence of its own 
    simplicity. It often yields a low 𝑅² with 
    known data and bad generalization capabilities 
    when applied with new data.
````

* Overfitting

````
    Overfitting  happens  when a  model learns  
    both dependencies  among  data  and random 
    fluctuations. In other words, a model learns 
    the existing data too well. Complex models, 
    which have many features or terms, are often 
    prone to overfitting.    When applied to known 
    data, such models usually yield high 𝑅². However, 
    they  often  don’t  generalize  well  and  have 
    significantly lower 𝑅² when used with new data.
