# Machine Learning Project

To bring together and apply the various topics 
covered in this course, you will work on a machine 
learning project. The goal of the project is to go 
through the complete knowledge discovery process 
to answer one or more questions you have about a 
topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the 
training data, query data, formulate a question 
(or questions) of interest, perform the data analysis 
(using machine learning algorithms), and communicate 
the results.

# Project Team

Students are encouraged to work in teams of 3–4 
(with a maximum of 4 members) for the course project. 

# Project Milestones

There are a few milestones for your final project. 
It is critical to note that no extensions will be 
given for any of the project due dates for any reason. 
Projects submitted after the final due date will not 
be graded. If you anticipate any issues you need to 
send an email to the instructor at least one week in 
advance. 

## Due Dates
Unless otherwise announced, all submission 
deadlines are at 11:59pm PST on the assigned due date.

# Deliverables

There are several deliverables for your project 
that will be graded individually to make up your 
final project score.

## Proposal

You start your project by forming your groups 
and letting the instructors know what topic you 
are interested in exploring. The proposal should 
be an informal written document submitted to the 
instructors in person or via email. The instructors 
will schedule a project review meeting with you 
during the week marked in the schedule. Make sure 
all of your team members are present at the meeting.

## Project Presentation

Each group will explain their project in a 10–15 
minute presentation to the class. Presentations 
should clearly convey the project ideas, methods, 
and results, including the question(s) being addressed, 
the motivation of the analyses being employed, and 
relevant evaluations, contributions, and discussion 
questions.

## Project Paper

The projects will be concluded with project paper. 
Your paper should summarize your steps in developing 
your solution, including how you collected the data, 
the method you used, and the insights obtained. The 
paper should be submitted in Word or PDF format. 
Optionally, you may submit a draft paper (in person 
or via email) by the listed deadline to receive feedback 
from the instructor prior to the final paper deadline.

# Grading

* 70% of the project grade will be based on your project paper
 (data selection, cleaning, ML algorithms, results, accuracy)
* 20% of the grade will be based on your project presentation. 
* 10% of the grade will be based on your final exam.

## The project proposal will be graded as follows:

* Title of Project:	5%	What's the title of the project?
* Project Plan:	30%	What do you plan to do?
* Data Sources and ML algorithms: 20%	
	* What data do you plan to use? 
	* From where will this data come? 
	* Selection of ML algorithms
* Proposed Evaluation: 30%	
	* How do you plan to evaluate your proposed ML model? 
	* How will you determine whether the model/method is successful?
* Writing Quality:	15%	
	* Clarity of expression (5%)
	* Organization (5%)
	* Grammar (5%)

## The project presentation will be graded as follows:

* Introduction:	15%	
	* Provide context. 
	* What questions are being addressed?
* Solution/Method:	30%	
	* What did you do? 
	* Why did you choose this method/model? 
	* What tools and techniques did you use?
* Data and Experiments:	10%	
	* What data did you use? 
	* Are your experimental models/methods reliable?
* Evaluation and Results:	30%	
	* What evaluation did you do? 
	* Do your conclusions match your results?
* Presentation Quality:	15%	
	* Clarity of speaking (5%) 
	* Organization (5%)
	* Visuals (5%)
              
              
## The project paper will be graded as follows:

* Introduction:	15%	
	* Provide context and motivation. 
	* What questions are being addressed? 
	* Why are these questions interesting or important?
* Related Work:	10%	
	* What other methods have addressed these or similar questions? 
	* How do these methods differ from your method?
* Solution/Method/model:	25%	
	* What did you do? 
	* What tools and techniques did you use? 
	* Was any innovation attempted?
* Data and Experiments:	10%	
	* What data did you use? 
	* Are your experimental methods reliable? 
	* What preprocessing was done the data?
* Evaluation and Results:	25%	
	* Did you properly evaluate your experiments/models? 
	* Did you test for statistical significance? 
	* Do your conclusions match your results?
* Writing Quality:	15%	
	* Clarity of writing (5%) 
	* Organization (5%) 
	* Grammar (5%)

# Submission Instructions
To submit your project deliverables, create a GIT repository 
and place you deliverables in designated folders (place your 
files in specific folders). The folder should include your project 
paper (Word or PDF format), presentation materials, and all code and 
output used to generate results. If I cannot access your work because 
these directions are not followed correctly, I will not grade your 
work.
