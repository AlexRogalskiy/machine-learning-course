## Course Description

This course introduces participants to quantitative techniques 
and algorithms that are based on big data (numerical and textual) 
or are theoretical models of big systems or optimization that are 
currently being used widely in business. It introduces topics that 
are often qualitative but that are now amenable to quantitative 
treatment. The course will prepare participants for more rigorous 
analysis of large data sets as well as introduce machine learning 
models and data analytics for business intelligence.

### Main Focus
The main focus of this class is to cover the following concepts:

* Basic concepts of Machine Learning
	* Supervised learning
	* Unsupervised learning
	* Reinforcement learning
	
* Linear Regression
	* scikit-learn
	* Spark ML
	* machine_learning_algorithms_from_scratch_SLR_sample_chapter.pdf
	
* Logistic Regression
	* scikit-learn
	* Spark ML
	
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
	* scikit-learn
	* Spark ML
	
* Clustering
	* K-means
	* Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
	* scikit-learn
	* Spark ML
