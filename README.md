## Course Description

* This course introduces participants to quantitative 
  techniques and algorithms that are based on big data 
  (numerical and textual) or are theoretical models of 
  big systems or optimization that are currently being 
  used widely in business. 

* It introduces topics that are often qualitative but 
  that are now amenable to quantitative treatment. 
  
* The course will prepare participants for more rigorous 
  analysis of large data sets as well as introduce machine 
  learning models and data analytics for business intelligence.
